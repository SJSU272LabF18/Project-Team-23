<h2><b>Project Idea :Analysis Of Right Turn accidents in California - APPROVED </b></h2>

comment: have to have predicting capability at granular level such as pedesterian accident 


<b>Description</b><br/><br/>
Right turn is frequent problem for big vehicles. Accidents can occur for many reasons, such as
when other vehicles squeeze into the are along the right side of your vehicle, failure to signal turn,
motorists not recognizing turn signals, driver was distracted etc. There is a need to analyze what
are the reasons for these accidents. Are they frequent in particular right turns and what causes
them.

<b>Proposed methodology</b><br/><br/>
In this project we will use the data for right turn accidents. And using data mining we will locate
the accident prone spots and factors causing those accidents. By taking corrective measures on
these spots based on analysis, number of accidents can be reduced.

<b>Resources</b><br/><br/>
Right turn accidents dataset.
